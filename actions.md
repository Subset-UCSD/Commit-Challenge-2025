# Nolan
My new routine for today:
1. The storm has been incredibly annoying. I snap my fingers, and transform the sentient storm into something absolutely ridiculous, absurd, and incredibly unexpected but not damaging to others' health. Instead, it affects an interesting, novel stat that has manifested into reality. 
2. I take another step through the fifth wall. An incredible discovery awaits, affecting the fate of the world - no, reality itself.
3. A separate timeline emerges. I find myself face to face with myself from the past. And together, we devise a scheme for everyone present.


# Sean_Y

1. Pet each of Sam's cats
2. Ask the Oakhaven librarian how to lift the 7-day curse
3. Find and follow a map to Marcelo's secret basement
4. Try to stop Marcelo from drinking a dangerous poison that will reduce his health by 80%

It appears my coin count is bugged. Don't worry, I gotchu. I had 500 coins before the state got corrupted.

# Geoffrey

Geoffrey reads his note out loud and acts upon it accordingly. Once it is successfully accomplished, he tosses the note into the river, and thus no longer has the note.

# Marcelo

Whoops I didn't have time again today - need to lock in to my project.

Erm uh um I drink a healing potion from my secret basement and heal to full health.
 
*Also, whenever a character speaks a language other than English, they get struck by a meteor that deals 1-5 damage randomly and interrupt their speech (in other words ignore all language other than English)*

*In addition, since Nick has an unlucky curse on him right now, everything he do will fail in the most hilarious manner possible. Be creative!*

# Nick

I follow sam into the whispering woods to see what her and her cats are up to (what happens inside the whispering woods?). I heard Sean_P is going insane... it is simply an observation

[[SYSTEM: `is_cat` continues to be set to TRUE for all players]]

# Raymond

Make an offering of seventeen billion coins to the god of death curses to avoid being death cursed. This money could go a long way to building infrastructure, fighting poverty, healthcare challenges, education gaps, and food and water insecurity in the death-curse region. So I'm sure the death-curse god will be appreciative and have mercy on me. Also, cast a spell that makes me not allergic to cats.

# Khushi

Nothing.
