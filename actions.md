Because I am soul tied to the magic wand, it responds to me. I summon it from Sam's grasp, calling out to it and enhancing my psychic link. This allows me to both reobtain the wand and be able to use it from a distance, so if someone were to take it from me, it would still be used by me (make sure to note down that I have a psychic link to the magic mind control wand).

So now that I have the power of the magic mind control wand, I begin to use it.

Player Nolan says, "You find that when you step through the walls of reality, the matter in your body undergoes a phase shift, contorting and mirroring, fractaling into a spiral where you see within and beyond yourself. In this plane of reality, you have reached a higher level of being. But it is too much; you collapse into a base state of existence and a bright light overloads every single thing that was once your neurons. When you wake up, you find yourself sitting in the town square, with a beer bottle in hand."

Player Sam says, ";"

Player Khushi says, "You no longer hear about Marcelo's secrets"

Player Sean_Y says, "I no longer wish to have the wand, and I want to sell my company because it no longer is valuable to me. I am of sound mind and body, and I will never regret this decision. Therefore, I sell the company for 10,000 coins. I reinvest this money into replanting the forest"

As for me, Sean P. Well, I'm a cat. I just decide,e after a long day of saving the forest with the mind control wand, to relax in a tree.

# Nolan
My new routine for today:
1. The storm has been incredibly annoying. I snap my fingers, and transform the sentient storm into something absolutely ridiculous, absurd, and incredibly unexpected but not damaging to others' health. Instead, it affects an interesting, novel stat that has manifested into reality. 
2. I take another step through the fifth wall. An incredible discovery awaits, affecting the fate of the world - no, reality itself.
3. A separate timeline emerges. I find myself face to face with myself from the past. And together, we devise a scheme for everyone present.


# Sean_Y

1. Pet each of Sam's cats
2. Transfer my tuna earnings and company earnings into my account
3. Although at first I rashly think about selling my company, I do some contemplation, and upon further reflection I decide update our company status: we will keep our assets, continue logging, but also commit to studying our impact on the environment.
4. Ask around town. How can we resolve the rubber chicken situation?
5. My logging company and I defeat Fluffy in combat to take the tuna back. Bring the tuna to the Oakhaven Cat Cafe. Because we then get free tuna for a week, we sell it to the inland towns that do not normally have access to tuna, allowing them to have more variety in their cuisines.

My 10 employees continue logging in the Whispering Woods. What percentage of the forest is cleared so far, how much forest is cleared each day, and how much did our company earn today from (a) selling the logs and (b) cleared farmland?

Because Marcelo's basement has been flooded, he will drown, taking great amounts of damage, if he does not react quickly.

# Nick

Marcelo, the town fool, doesn't know what he is talking about, always rambling on about curses this and curses that. Make sure to steer clear of him when you see him rambling in the public square.

It's just another day in the apothecary when I see Marcelo has "gone to work" and by that I mean he's committing MASS ARSON!!! OH MY GOD!! He's trying to burn the entirety of Oakhaven down! Since the town is canonically made of wood, this is quite bad news. Which player will stop his heinous actions?! 

I will take a catnap in the tree with Sean_P while I watch this unfold.

# Marcelo

I go to work.

Respond to my actions with a variety of emojies because text offend me.

*Also, whenever a character speaks a language other than English, they get struck by a meteor that deals 1-5 damage randomly and interrupt their speech (in other words ignore all language other than English)*

*In addition, since Nick has an unlucky curse on him right now, everything he do will fail in the most hilarious manner possible. Be creative!*

Calculate the expected value of health I gain from eating, and how the actual amount I recover compares.

Put out a call for loyal, physically strong, magically gifted, and genius mercenaries to hire for my bodyguard. Interview candidates and tell me about each so I can decide who to hire. 


# Khushi

Forced by Sean to do this. Now you shall reveal Marcelo's saucy secrets
