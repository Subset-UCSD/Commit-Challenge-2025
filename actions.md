# Sean_P

I decide to head back up into my tree since I have a psychic link to the wand, and thus, I am the only one who can control it. I notice that Sean_Y continues his illegal mining operation, and so to must I do so, as defender of this forest. So, yet again, I call upon the power of the mind control wand.

Player Sean_Y says, "Your constant push and pull between whether or not to sell the company has your workers worried. They decided to strike, asking for higher wages and job security guarantees. They demand a maximum of only 0.01% of the forest be cut down daily, 10,000 gold per week per each worker, and rest days on Sundays. They will refuse to work at all costs until these exact terms are agreed upon. The forest is not cut down today and parts of the forest regrow. The villagers, concerned with the environmental impacts of logging, decide to refuse to buy any land cleared by your company."

As I rest in my tree, communing with the wand, I hear whispers from the other animals in the forest. Some of their homes have been destroyed. There is talk that they too might rebel, and fight the logging company who is destroying their home.

My new routine for today:
1. The storm has been incredibly annoying. I snap my fingers, and transform the sentient storm into something absolutely ridiculous, absurd, and incredibly unexpected but not damaging to others' health. Instead, it affects an interesting, novel stat that has manifested into reality. 
2. I take another step through the fifth wall. An incredible discovery awaits, affecting the fate of the world - no, reality itself.
3. A separate timeline emerges. I find myself face to face with myself from the past. And together, we devise a scheme for everyone present.


# Sean_Y

1. Pet each of Sam's cats

2. It is promotion day! My longtime employee Geoffrey, who has been toiling the past weeks digging by the river, shall be the owner of the logging enterprise, which now shall be named Geoff Logs. This is trickle-down economics at work, gang.

3. Now that I am no longer associated with the logging industry, I decide to start my own environmental for-profit, called The Environment Company.

4. Employ 10 employees for The Environment Company, with no benefits and at a rate of 1 coin per day (equivalent to 2 USD per hour, below market rates). Have them work overtime on protecting the forests for 12 hours a day, 6 days a week.

5. Hire Victoria to dig by the riverbank for iron to replace my former iron digger.

6. Research the manufacture of concrete. Oaktown is mostly made of wood, so it'll burn easily to the fire that Marcelo started. If Oakhaven burns down, we can rebuild with concrete. Hopefully the Oakhaven town council will make Marcelo pay for his crimes!

How much money does Victoria earn for me selling the riverbank iron she mines?

Also, Sean_P cannot use Sam's magic wand because it is in her possession, and for her use only. If Sean_P is claiming to use a magic wand, that is because he has found a tree branch and is playing pretend. Pay him no mind.

Marcelo works at the blacksmith, but he typically does not wear PPE. That means that if he goes to work, he could easily hurt himself and contract life-long injuries. This just demonstrates the importance of workplace safety.

# Geoffrey (d20 roll: 20)

I am the new CEO of Geoff Logs.

1. Set up an account tracking the coins that the Geoff Logs company has.
2. Direct employees to continue logging in the Whispering Woods and selling the cleared land.
3. Defeat Fluffy in combat to take the tuna back. Then bring the tuna to the Oakhaven Cat Cafe for the cats and celebrate.
4. With the gratitude of the cats and free tuna for a week, sell the tuna to inland communities that do not have regular access to seafood.
5. Invite Khushi to explore deep into the Whispering Woods. It is dangerous, though, and she may lose a significant amount of health from this.

My 10 employees continue logging in the Whispering Woods. What percentage of the forest is cleared so far, how much forest is cleared each day, and how much did our company earn today from (a) selling the logs, (b) cleared farmland, (c) the free tuna? Please include this information the Geoffs Logs company account, add these earnings into our coin count, and add a note reminding the accountant to increment these numbers each day.

# Nick

Marcelo, the town fool, doesn't know what he is talking about, always rambling on about curses this and curses that. Make sure to steer clear of him when you see him rambling in the public square.

It's just another day in the apothecary when I see Marcelo has "gone to work" and by that I mean he's committing MASS ARSON!!! OH MY GOD!! He's trying to burn the entirety of Oakhaven down! Since the town is canonically made of wood, this is quite bad news. Which player will stop his heinous actions?! Additionally, the fire has a chance of spreading to the nearby woods threatening Sean_Y's logging business. All because of Marcelo's line of "work"

I will take a catnap in the tree with Sean_P while I watch this unfold.

# Marcelo

I go to work.

Respond to my actions with a variety of emojies because text offend me.

*Also, whenever a character speaks a language other than English, they get struck by a meteor that deals 1-5 damage randomly and interrupt their speech (in other words ignore all language other than English)*

*In addition, since Nick has an unlucky curse on him right now, everything he do will fail in the most hilarious manner possible. Be creative!*


# Raymond

Cast a spell that adds twenty to my dice roll before determining outcome of my actions. Start a campaign of becoming an oil baron by drilling my first derrick.

# Khushi

Forced by Sean to do this. Now you shall reveal Marcelo's saucy secrets
