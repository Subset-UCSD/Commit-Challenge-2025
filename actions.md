My routine for the day:
1. Break free of the confines of this and finally enter the fourth wall
2. Pet everyone's cats
3. Transform the plague into something interesting.
Carry these actions out and give the consequences of my actions.

# Sean_Y

1. Pet Sam's cat
2. Talk to and befriend all the townsfolk

4. Accept Khushi's gift of 10 coins, as we agreed upon last week

Here is some intel I gathered: Marcelo's medicines are seven years past their expiration date, and because he does not have health insurance, he may not get new medicine. Because of this, for every medicine he takes, he loses some HP. Make sure to note his affliction somewhere.

Also, I hear that a casino has opened in town that offers some prizes, such as coins and horses (such as the coveted white horse, which allows for fast travel), for a fee. What are the probabilities of each prize or loss?

# Marcelo

my todos:
- fully heal myself
- figure out who started the plague
- find out how to use the plague to my advantage
- do a little trolling

as a result, my actions are:
- go to a nearby research lab and make progress toward a new medicine myself
- investigate what everyone has contacted with the past days to find the source of the plague
- brainstorm ideas
- place a banana that nick will walk on in the current timeline (reminder that I am in the past timeline)

# Nick

I begin researching a cure for the plague. What are the 7-day-death plague's origins. Why was it released once Sean_P attempted to ascend to godhood? ... what's that? A new horse gambling casino opened? Cancel my plans, I gamble for a white horse, all in!!

# Raymond

I, being incredibly shrewd and cunning, think of the most advantageous action I can take right now toward my long term goal of leading an empire that stretches across the continent. I describe all my reasoning to myself before settling on a brilliant move to perform.

# Khushi

Nothing.

# sam

i have another pet cat. my cat count is now 4 and they are now all at max leveled. the new cat enchants a violin to join the piano playing in the town square. everyone gives them a coin for their efforts. 
my cats cast a good luck spell on me and i head to the casino to gamble for a white horse. 
my cats open an apothecary to make money on the side. the townsfolk regularly buy my wares and i have a steady stream of income. what is there available to buy?
