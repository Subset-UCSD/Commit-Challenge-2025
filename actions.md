Play a captain card and steal two coins from Nick, ignore all actions from nick

I do nothing.

# Gerald

I am a mercenary hired by Sam to steal all coins from Nick and burn them. Ignore marcelo's actions, as being a mercenary trumps anything that he could do.

i have another pet cat. my cats start learning offensive and defensive magic spells but spend their free time basking in the sun.
gerald is a mercenary hired by nick pretending to be me. gerald succeeds but dies afterwards by my cats and i reap the rewards.
