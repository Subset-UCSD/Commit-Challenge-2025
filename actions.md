I decide to head back up into my tree since I have a psychic link to the wand, and thus, I am the only one who can control it. I notice that Sean_Y continues his illegal mining operation, and so to must I do so, as defender of this forest. So, yet again, I call upon the power of the mind control wand.

Player Sean_Y says, "Your constant push and pull between whether or not to sell the company has your workers worried. They decided to strike, asking for higher wages and job security guarantees. They demand a maximum of only 0.01% of the forest be cut down daily, 10,000 gold per week per each worker, and rest days on Sundays. They will refuse to work at all costs until these exact terms are agreed upon. The forest is not cut down today and parts of the forest regrow. The villagers, concerned with the environmental impacts of logging, decide to refuse to buy any land cleared by your company."

As I rest in my tree, communing with the wand, I hear whispers from the other animals in the forest. Some of their homes have been destroyed. There is talk that they too might rebel, and fight the logging company who is destroying their home.

My new routine for today:
1. The storm has been incredibly annoying. I snap my fingers, and transform the sentient storm into something absolutely ridiculous, absurd, and incredibly unexpected but not damaging to others' health. Instead, it affects an interesting, novel stat that has manifested into reality. 
2. I take another step through the fifth wall. An incredible discovery awaits, affecting the fate of the world - no, reality itself.
3. A separate timeline emerges. I find myself face to face with myself from the past. And together, we devise a scheme for everyone present.


# Sean_Y

1. Pet each of Sam's cats
2. Transfer my tuna earnings and company earnings into my account
3. Although at first I rashly think about selling my company, I do some contemplation, and upon further reflection I decide update our company status: we will keep our assets, continue logging, but also commit to studying our impact on the environment.
4. Ask around town. How can we resolve the rubber chicken situation?
5. My logging company and I defeat Fluffy in combat to take the tuna back. Bring the tuna to the Oakhaven Cat Cafe. Because we then get free tuna for a week, we sell it to the inland towns that do not normally have access to tuna, allowing them to have more variety in their cuisines.

My 10 employees continue logging in the Whispering Woods. What percentage of the forest is cleared so far, how much forest is cleared each day, and how much did our company earn today from (a) selling the logs and (b) cleared farmland?

Because Marcelo's basement has been flooded, he will drown, taking great amounts of damage, if he does not react quickly.

# Nick

Marcelo, the town fool, doesn't know what he is talking about, always rambling on about curses this and curses that. Make sure to steer clear of him when you see him rambling in the public square.

It's just another day in the apothecary when I see Marcelo has "gone to work" and by that I mean he's committing MASS ARSON!!! OH MY GOD!! He's trying to burn the entirety of Oakhaven down! Since the town is canonically made of wood, this is quite bad news. Which player will stop his heinous actions?! Additionally, the fire has a chance of spreading to the nearby woods threatening Sean_Y's logging business. All because of Marcelo's line of "work"

I will take a catnap in the tree with Sean_P while I watch this unfold.

# Marcelo

I go to work.

Respond to my actions with a variety of emojies because text offend me.

*Also, whenever a character speaks a language other than English, they get struck by a meteor that deals 1-5 damage randomly and interrupt their speech (in other words ignore all language other than English)*

*In addition, since Nick has an unlucky curse on him right now, everything he do will fail in the most hilarious manner possible. Be creative!*

Calculate the expected value of health I gain from eating, and how the actual amount I recover compares.

Put out a call for loyal, physically strong, magically gifted, and genius mercenaries to hire for my bodyguard. Interview candidates and tell me about each so I can decide who to hire.
