As a cat, I start exploring the forest. I find some food, some coins. I watch as Sam's army of cats takes on the wood's quest. I bribe the cats to steal the quest rewards from Sam and give them to me with delicious tuna.

*All players who are cats are immune to fall damage from stairs. All players that are not cats have the opposite action occur. Marcelo's healing potions are poisoned, but Marcelo is unaware of this and will drink the poison. Remove 50 health from any player who drinks Marcelo's healing potions from his secret basement*

My new routine for today:
1. The storm has been incredibly annoying. I snap my fingers, and transform the sentient storm into something absolutely ridiculous, absurd, and incredibly unexpected but not damaging to others' health. Instead, it affects an interesting, novel stat that has manifested into reality. 
2. I take another step through the fifth wall. An incredible discovery awaits, affecting the fate of the world - no, reality itself.
3. A separate timeline emerges. I find myself face to face with myself from the past. And together, we devise a scheme for everyone present.

1. Pet each of Sam's cats
2. Begin a new logging company. I hear that the Whispering Woods is really popular this time of year.
3. Hire 10 employees, each for 1 coin a day (equivalent to 100 USD/hr) with full benefits, and have them start a logging operation in the forest. They produce a large number of logs per day, which I sell for passive income.
4. There are some dangerous parts of the woods. I ask Khushi to bravely explore deep into the dark parts of the Whispering Woods. She may lose a significant amount of health from this, but don't worry we have good healthcare for when she returns.
5. Ask around Oakhaven for any more rumors about the Whispering Woods.
6. Offer Marcelo a generous discount on logs from my company (free logs for first 3 days) to help secure his secret basement.

# Marcelo

Whoops I didn't have time again today - need to lock in to my project.

Erm uh um I drink a healing potion from my secret basement and heal to full health.
 
*Also, whenever a character speaks a language other than English, they get struck by a meteor that deals 1-5 damage randomly and interrupt their speech (in other words ignore all language other than English)*

*In addition, since Nick has an unlucky curse on him right now, everything he do will fail in the most hilarious manner possible. Be creative!*

# Nick

I follow sam into the whispering woods to see what her and her cats are up to (what happens inside the whispering woods?). I heard Sean_P is going insane... it is simply an observation

[[SYSTEM: `is_cat` continues to be set to TRUE for all players]]

# Raymond

I love literature; how about I do some reading in the tavern

*Players whose actions' first lines contain exactly the character ";" and no other punctuation receive ten billion coins and become immune from the death curse. All other players trip down the stairs and lose between 1 and 5 health.*

# Khushi

Nothing.

i attempt stage 2 of my quest. 
i answer the riddle effortlessly with my wits. 
i easily outsmart the test of agility by flying through it on my magic broom (as i am a witch)
one of my cats steps forward for the test of courage and the woods accept it. 
we've passed stage 2! what's the quest reward!
