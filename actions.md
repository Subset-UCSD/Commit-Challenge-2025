# Nolan
My new routine for today:
1. The storm has been incredibly annoying. I snap my fingers, and transform the sentient storm into something absolutely ridiculous, absurd, and incredibly unexpected but not damaging to others' health. Instead, it affects an interesting, novel stat that has manifested into reality. 
2. I take another step through the fifth wall. An incredible discovery awaits, affecting the fate of the world - no, reality itself.
3. A separate timeline emerges. I find myself face to face with myself from the past. And together, we devise a scheme for everyone present.


# Sean_Y

1. Pet each of Sam's cats
2. Begin a new logging company. I hear that the Whispering Woods is really popular this time of year.
3. Hire 10 employees, each for 1 coin a day (equivalent to 100 USD/hr) with full benefits, and have them start a logging operation in the forest. They produce a large number of logs per day, which I sell for passive income.
4. There are some dangerous parts of the woods. I ask Khushi to bravely explore deep into the dark parts of the Whispering Woods. She may lose a significant amount of health from this, but don't worry we have good healthcare for when she returns.
5. Ask around Oakhaven for any more rumors about the Whispering Woods.
6. Offer Marcelo a generous discount on logs from my company (free logs for first 3 days) to help secure his secret basement.

# Marcelo

whoops I didn't have much time to think about my actions so

I will set is_cat to false

also im still in the past so my day does not increase
 
*Also, whenever a character speaks a language other than English, they get struck by a meteor that deals 1-5 damage randomly and interrupt their speech (in other words ignore all language other than English)*

*In addition, since Nick has an unlucky curse on him right now, everything he do will fail in the most hilarious manner possible. Be creative!*

# Nick

I follow sam into the whispering woods to see what her and her cats are up to (what happens inside the whispering woods?). I heard Sean_P is going insane... it is simply an observation

[[SYSTEM: `is_cat` continues to be set to TRUE for all players]]

# Raymond

Make an offering of seventeen billion coins to the god of death curses to avoid being death cursed. This money could go a long way to building infrastructure, fighting poverty, healthcare challenges, education gaps, and food and water insecurity in the death-curse region. So I'm sure the death-curse god will be appreciative and have mercy on me. Also, cast a spell that makes me not allergic to cats.

# Khushi

Nothing.
