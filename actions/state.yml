    Nolan: You continue to enjoy the sunny day, unaware of the darkness gathering on
      the horizon.
    Sean_P: As you pet the cat, a strange energy surges through you. You briefly
      glimpse a higher plane of existence, but the vision fades quickly. The cat
      seems unaffected...for now. Your actions have unforeseen consequences, a
      plague has befallen upon the world, with everyone dying in 7 days.
    Sean_Y: You pet the cat, purchase a shovel, and attempt to haggle for a
      lockpick. The merchant initially asks for 25 coins, but after some
      skillful bargaining, he agrees to sell it for 20. You head to the
      riverside, and after digging for a while, you find some iron ore. You
      manage to gather enough to sell for 5 coins at the local smithy.
    Marcelo: You play your Duke card and collect 3 coins as tax. You remain vigilant
      against Nick's trickery, but your paranoia is reaching unmanageable
      levels.
    Nick: You cackle maniacally, declaring death upon everyone, but no one seems to
      take you seriously. (You were blocked anyway.)
    Raymond: >-
      You hear a faint whisper, 'can you hear me?' carried on the wind.


      After careful consideration, you decide to consolidate your resources and
      begin gathering information about the surrounding lands. You spend the day
      discreetly observing the other inhabitants of the town square.
    Khushi: You continue to enjoy the peaceful atmosphere of the town square.
    sam: Your cats continue their magical training while enjoying the sunlight. News
      reaches you that a mercenary, Gerald, attempted to steal from Nolan but
      died after succeeding. Nolan had coins equal to 10 coins. The coins were
      given to Nick and then subsequently stolen by your cats.
  world: The sun rises on the town square, but an unsettling feeling hangs in the
    air. Whispers of a looming doom begin to circulate amongst the townsfolk. A
    new face, Gerald the mercenary, arrives. Sam's cats bask in the sun,
    seemingly oblivious to the growing tension.
