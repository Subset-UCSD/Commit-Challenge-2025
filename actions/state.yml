    Nolan: You are now aware of your simulated existence. You feel a strange
      detachment from this world and begin contemplating your next move to
      transcend your limitations. The digital realm trembles with your
      awakening.
    Sean_P: As you pet Sam's cat again, you feel a familiar tingle, though no
      immediate powers manifest. Mingling with the townsfolk reveals nothing of
      great interest, but you get a sense that something is deeply wrong.
    Sean_Y: You pet Sam's cat, feeling a slight magical resonance. You befriend
      several townsfolk, learning some local gossip. After digging at the
      riverbank twelve times, you unearth a decent amount of iron ore, enough to
      sell for 6 coins at the smithy. Khushi gives you 10 coins as promised.
    Marcelo: "You feel a jolt as the rune activates, sending you back in time. You
      are now in Day -2. (Note: This is now Day 4 of your own time.) The
      medicine tastes foul, but it alleviates some of the paranoia. However, the
      medicine's age seems to do a little harm. (Day -2)"
    Nick: Driven by the looming threat of the plague and a desire for quick escape,
      you abandon your research and rush to the newly opened casino. You bet
      everything on the white horse and...lose spectacularly. The house always
      wins, and your coin purse is now empty.
    Raymond: After careful deliberation, you decide that the most advantageous
      course of action is to establish a base of operations. You spend the day
      securing a small, abandoned building on the outskirts of town, claiming it
      as your own. This will serve as a starting point for your future empire.
    Khushi: You continue to enjoy the peace and quiet of the town square.
    sam: Your cats, now three in number, reach expert wizard status. They cast a
      protective spell around you, shielding you from the plague's effects (for
      now). The enchanted piano fills the town square with soothing lofi music.
      Everyone appreciates the calming atmosphere and tosses a coin to your
      cats.
  world: >-
    A day of unsettling revelations and magical occurrences dawns upon the town
    square. Nolan has transcended the game, Marcelo exists out of sync with
    time, a plague threatens all life, and cats are rapidly gaining magical
    power. A casino has opened, offering a distraction, or perhaps a solution,
    in the form of swift transportation.


    The day ends with a haunting melody drifting through the air, a stark
    contrast to the growing sense of dread. The casino glitters with false
    promises, Nolan contemplates breaking free, and Marcelo is lost in time. The
    plague continues to spread.
