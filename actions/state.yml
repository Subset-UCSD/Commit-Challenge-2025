      response: Your constant push and pull between whether or not to sell the company
        has your workers worried. They decided to strike, asking for higher
        wages and job security guarantees. They demand a maximum of only 0.01%

        and rest days on Sundays. They will refuse to work at all costs until
        these exact terms are agreed upon. The forest is not cut down today and
