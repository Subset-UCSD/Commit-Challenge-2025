    The crimson shift intensifies, bathing the universe in an oppressive red
    light. Stars appear dimmer, planets are cast in an eerie glow, and the sky
    itself seems to weep blood. The ability to heal, even from minor injuries,
    is drastically reduced. You feel the countdown to the end nearing. The
    seventh day approaches.


    SYSTEM: Opposite Week is in effect.
