    1. The storm has been incredibly annoying. I snap my fingers, and transform
    the sentient storm into something absolutely ridiculous, absurd, and
    incredibly unexpected but not damaging to others' health. Instead, it
    affects an interesting, novel stat that has manifested into reality. 

    2. I take another step through the fifth wall. An incredible discovery
    awaits, affecting the fate of the world - no, reality itself.

    3. A separate timeline emerges. I find myself face to face with myself from
    the past. And together, we devise a scheme for everyone present.

      The storm is now a breeze, quite absurd,
      Which forces all tongues into verse, unheard!
      Fifth wall, you now breach,
      Within your mind's reach,
      A new reality, bravely conferred.

      You've discovered the deities' game of tag!
      Beware, for cat chaos is now in your bag.
      Prepare for the meows,
      The unpredictable bows,
      As feline mayhem begins to swag!

      You meet your past self, a sight most uncanny,
      Together, you plot, a plan oh so zany!
      Dance in the courts,
      A legal recourse,
      Oakhaven's justice, delightfully fanny!
    Sean_P: Meow! You are now, unequivocally, a cat.
    Sean_Y: >-
      You pet one of Sam's cats! It purrs with satisfaction.

      You begin a new logging company, 'Y-Logs', specializing in Whispering
      Woods timber. Ten employees are hired at a rate of one coin per day.


      Unfortunately, you don't have enough coins to pay all your employees
      today! One employee quits.

      You ask Khushi to bravely explore the deep parts of the Whispering Woods,
      citing excellent healthcare benefits. You offer her one coin, and a
      promise of free logs for life.


      You unfortunately don't have enough coin to pay Khushi for her services.
      She refuses to go.


      You ask around Oakhaven for rumors about the Whispering Woods. You hear
      whispers of a strange plague affecting the trees.


      You offer Marcelo free logs for the first three days, hoping to secure his
      secret basement. He seems intrigued.
    Marcelo: You drink a healing potion from your secret basement, restoring
      yourself to full health.
    Nick: You successfully follow Sam into the Whispering Woods, observing her and
      her cats. Sean_P's sanity is of no concern to you.
    Raymond: >-
      You do not have enough coins to appease the god of death curses. Your fate
      remains uncertain.


      You attempt to cast a spell that removes your allergy to cats. The spell
      succeeds, and you are no longer plagued by hives at the mere thought of a
      feline.
    Khushi: >-
      Since Sean_Y doesn't have enough coin, you deny the request to explore the
      Whispering Woods.


      You do nothing today.
    sam: >-
      You gather the required supplies for your quest: 10 Healing Potions, 5
      Mana Potions, and a map of the Whispering Woods.


      You enter the Whispering Woods, your cats padding silently beside you.
  world: >-
    The oppressive crimson light of the death curse has faded, though the air
    still carries a strange, unsettling energy. Cats continue to meow
    incessantly, a constant reminder of the feline apocalypse. A new day dawns,
    but the world feels irrevocably changed.


    A notice appears on the town's quest board: "The Whispering Plague: A
    strange plague is spreading through the Whispering Woods, causing the trees
    to whisper secrets and driving creatures mad. Find the source of the plague
    and contain it before it spreads to Oakhaven."


    With a snap of Nolan's fingers, the sentient storm transforms into a gentle
    breeze that compels everyone to speak in limericks. The air fills with
    whimsical rhymes.


    Nolan steps through the fifth wall, discovering that the true reality is a
    game of cosmic tag being played by bored deities. He learns a new rule:
    Anyone tagged becomes slightly more susceptible to cat-related chaos.


    A separate timeline emerges, revealing Nolan from yesterday! Together, you
    devise a scheme to introduce interpretive dance into Oakhaven's legal
    system.
