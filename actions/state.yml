      response: Your constant push and pull between whether or not to sell the company
        has your workers worried. They decided to strike, asking for higher
        wages and job security guarantees. They demand a maximum of only 0.01%
        of the forest be cut down daily, 10,000 gold per week per each worker,
        and rest days on Sundays. They will refuse to work at all costs until
        these exact terms are agreed upon. The forest is not cut down today and
        parts of the forest regrow. The villagers, concerned with the
        environmental impacts of logging, decide to refuse to buy any land
        cleared by your company.
