    Nolan: You spend the day basking in the sun in the town square.
    Sean_P: You spend the day basking in the sun in the town square.
    Sean_Y: Various tools are available at the market, ranging from simple shovels
      and pickaxes (10 coins each) to more advanced lockpicks (25 coins) and
      even rare alchemical kits (100 coins). The quality varies, so inspect
      before you buy!
    Marcelo: You attempt to play a Captain card and steal two coins from Nick, but
      he lacks a captain card. Nick loses 2 coins.
    Nick: Marcelo attempts to steal from you, and you are defenseless. You lose 2
      coins.
    Raymond: You spend the day basking in the sun in the town square.
    Khushi: You spend the day basking in the sun in the town square.
    sam: Your cat purrs contentedly beside you, enjoying the sunny day in the town
      square. It seems quite popular with the local children.
  world: The sun shines brightly on the town square. A tense standoff occurs
    between Marcelo and Nick. Whispers circulate about available tools. A fluffy
    cat meows nearby.
