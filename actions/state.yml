    1. The storm has been incredibly annoying. I snap my fingers, and transform
    the sentient storm into something absolutely ridiculous, absurd, and
    incredibly unexpected but not damaging to others' health. Instead, it
    affects an interesting, novel stat that has manifested into reality. 

    2. I take another step through the fifth wall. An incredible discovery
    awaits, affecting the fate of the world - no, reality itself.

    3. A separate timeline emerges. I find myself face to face with myself from
    the past. And together, we devise a scheme for everyone present.

    Nolan: "The limerick-speaking breeze persists, but with a strange new twist: all
      conversations now must include interpretive dance. Fifth wall broken
      again! You discover that deities are now using mortals as chess pieces!
      Prepare for the consequences. Your past self approves of the plan for
      interpretive dance in court, solidifying the absurdity."
    Sean_P: As a cat, you prowl into the forest, your senses heightened. You find a
      discarded fish bone (no meat) and a single coin glinting beneath a
      mushroom. The air crackles with feline intrigue as you witness Sam's cats
      embarking on a quest.
    Sean_Y: >-
      You have successfully added 500 coins to your inventory.


      You pet each of Sam's cats with great enthusiasm.


      You successfully pay your employees their wages, ensuring a productive day
      for Y-Logs.


      You establish Y-Logs, a logging company specializing in Whispering Woods
      timber. Your employees begin their work.


      You offer Khushi one coin to bravely explore the deep parts of the
      Whispering Woods.


      You ask around Oakhaven for more rumors about the Whispering Woods. You
      hear whispers of a large shipment of tuna going missing, potentially
      related to the cat apocalypse.
    Marcelo: |-
      You awaken in your secret basement, feeling refreshed.

      You take a swig of your healing potion. It tastes... off. Very off.

      You feel incredibly ill. Your health is now 50.
    Nick: >-
      Through your fervent dedication to killing trees, you hit the Tree Gold
      Mine and are so ascended that you get a whopping amount of coins: 100000!


      As you attempt to sneakily snatch the rewards from Sean_P, you trip over a
      particularly stubborn root, sending you tumbling headfirst into a pile of
      particularly scratchy thorns. In the process, you somehow manage to
      accidentally set your own trousers on fire with a misplaced magnifying
      glass, which you didn't realize you even had.


      Your clumsy antics attract the attention of a flock of grumpy pixies, who
      proceed to pelt you with acorns and ridicule your fashion sense. Your
      stealth attempt is a complete and utter failure.
    Raymond: >-
      As you settle down in the tavern with a book, you trip down the stairs!
      You lose 2 health.


      Your health is now 93.
    Khushi: >-
      You spend another peaceful day doing absolutely nothing.


      As you attempt to do absolutely nothing, you trip down the stairs! You
      lose 3 health.


      Your health is now 93.


      Sean_Y offers you one coin to explore the dangerous parts of the
      Whispering Woods.


      You bravely explore into the deep part of the Whispering Woods and
      encounter a lot of spooky creatures and get scared! You lose 18 health and
      are now at 75 health!
    sam: >-
      You bravely embark on stage 2 of your quest! Your quick wits allow you to
      effortlessly solve the riddle. Soaring through the agility test on your
      magic broom, you find it child's play.


      One of your courageous cats steps forward for the test of courage, their
      feline heart overflowing with bravery. The woods, sensing this pure
      spirit, deems you worthy.


      You have completed stage 2 of your quest!


      The reward for this stage is a detailed map leading to the artifact's
      location. You feel a surge of excitement!

    The sun rises over Oakhaven, casting long shadows that dance with the
    whispers of the breeze. The air is thick with the scent of pine and the
    faint, unsettling aroma of... tuna? Whispers of a feline heist and a plague
    in the woods fill the air, and the townsfolk continue to converse solely in
    limericks, much to their chagrin.


    You successfully bribe some of Sam's cats with tuna (where did you get
    that?!) to steal quest rewards on your behalf.
