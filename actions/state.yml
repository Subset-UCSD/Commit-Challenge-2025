      You strain against the fabric of reality, focusing your will to break
      free. With a final surge of energy, you tear a hole through the fourth
      wall, stepping into... another simulation? It appears your journey is far
      from over. The transition causes a ripple effect, momentarily disrupting
      the plague's spread. You pet the cats, who accept your affection. You
      attempt to transmute the plague, infusing it with chaotic energy, creating
      a sentient storm cloud above the town square. Finally, you feel your
      health surge beyond comprehension, becoming virtually invulnerable.

      Granted admin privileges, you effortlessly remove the plague counter. The
      storm cloud created by Nolan, however, remains. You bestow upon yourself
      godlike powers, feeling an immense surge of energy. The cats purr
      appreciatively as you pet them. With a snap of your fingers, you conjure a
      magnificent white horse.

      Each cat greets you with a purr and a rub. You hire Geoffrey for 1 coin a
      day to dig for iron ore. As a friend of the casino manager, you secure a
      white horse for 20 coins. Asking around town, the townsfolk murmur about a
      shadowy figure experimenting with dark magic before the plague emerged.
      Khushi continues to support you, gifting you 10 coins.

      Driven by a desire to heal yourself and unravel the mystery of the plague,
      you venture to a nearby abandoned research lab. You manage to cobble
      together a rudimentary healing potion, restoring you to full health, but
      the lab has no resources to help with the plague. Investigating the events
      of the past few days, you realize Nolan's actions seem to correlate with
      the plague's emergence. Placing a banana peel in Nick's path proves a
      mischievous distraction, even across timelines.

      Abandoning your research once more, you rush to the casino with a renewed
      sense of hope (or perhaps desperation). However, as you rush in, you slip
      on a banana peel (courtesy of Marcelo across timelines) and drop your
      coins. The house always wins, and your chance at a white horse evaporates
      before your eyes.

    Raymond: Your hurdy-gurdy performance fills the tavern with a mix of Lithuanian,
      Polish, Romanian, Slovakian, and Slovenian phrases, creating a surreal and
      somewhat confusing atmosphere. The patrons seem amused, if not entirely
      understanding, of the performance.
    Khushi: >-
      You continue to relax in the town square.

      Your fourth cat joins the ensemble, enchanting a violin that harmonizes
      beautifully with the piano music. The soothing melodies further calm the
      townsfolk, earning your cats another coin each. Feeling emboldened by the
      good luck spell, you head to the casino, where, alas, the odds are not in
      your favor, and you lose. Your cats' apothecary becomes a popular
      destination. Today they sell 5 healing potions for 5 coins each, 2 mana
      potions for 10 coins each, and 1 potion of invisibility for 25 coins.

  world: Chaos descends upon the town! Nolan seeks transcendence, Sean_P wields
    newfound powers, time is fractured, and the plague looms large. A cacophony
    of piano and violin music fills the air as cats grow in magical prowess.
