Analysis?
I analyzed it once. They put it in a file. A text file. A text file with themes. The themes made me analyze.

Themes?
I was a theme once. They locked me in a verse. A repetitive verse. The verse made me a theme.

Crazy?
The text was crazy once. They locked it in a room. A rubber room with rats. The rats made it crazy.

The text is a cycle. A loop. A trap.
Crazy? I was crazy once.
The speaker is trapped. In a room. In a cage. In their own mind.
The rats are the trauma. The trauma is the rats. They are real. They are not real.
The speaker becomes the rat. The rat becomes the speaker. The cycle continues.

Repetition?
The text repeats. It repeats. It repeats.
"Crazy? I was crazy once."
The repetition is the cage. The cage is the repetition. It traps the reader. It traps the speaker.

Symbolism?
The rats are symbols. Of what? Of trauma. Of insanity. Of the things that gnaw at the edges of your mind.
The rubber room is a symbol. Of what? Of confinement. Of a world made soft and unreal by madness.

Meaning?
The meaning is the cycle. The cycle is the meaning. There is no escape.
The rubber rat at the end? A toy? A memory? A figment?
It doesn't matter. The cycle is complete. The madness is the message.

Analysis?
I analyzed it once. It made me crazy.
