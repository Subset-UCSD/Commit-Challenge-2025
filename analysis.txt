The provided text is a series of short, repetitive verses that explore themes of insanity, confinement, and the cyclical nature of trauma. The repetition of "Crazy? I was crazy once" creates a looping, obsessive quality, mirroring the speaker's potential mental state.

Here's a breakdown of the analysis:

**Themes:**

*   **Insanity and Sanity:** The text directly confronts the concept of being "crazy," questioning its definition and origin. The speaker's repeated declaration of past craziness suggests a struggle with their own mental state and how it's perceived.
*   **Confinement:** The imagery of a "rubber room" and a "cage" evokes a sense of being trapped, both physically and mentally. This confinement is a direct cause of the speaker's distress.
*   **Trauma and its Cycles:** The text demonstrates how trauma can be cyclical and self-perpetuating. The rats make the speaker crazy, and in the next verse, the speaker *becomes* a rat, suggesting an internalization of the trauma. The final verse, with the "rubber rat," introduces a new layer, where the source of the trauma becomes an inanimate object, blurring the lines between reality and delusion.

**Literary Devices:**

*   **Repetition:** The repetition of phrases like "Crazy? I was crazy once" and the overall structure of the verses create a powerful, rhythmic effect. This repetition emphasizes the cyclical and obsessive nature of the speaker's thoughts.
*   **Symbolism:**
    *   **Rats:** Rats are often associated with disease, infestation, and things that are unwanted. In this context, they symbolize the source of the speaker's torment and the intrusive thoughts that drive them to insanity.
    *   **Rubber Room/Cage:** These represent confinement and the loss of freedom. The "rubber" quality adds a surreal, almost childlike element, which contrasts sharply with the dark themes of the text.
*   **Shifting Perspectives:** The speaker's identity shifts from a person tormented by rats to a rat themselves. This change in perspective highlights the psychological impact of the trauma, where the victim begins to identify with the source of their suffering.

**Overall Meaning:**

The text can be interpreted as a powerful and unsettling exploration of how trauma can warp a person's sense of self and reality. The cyclical nature of the verses suggests that there is no escape from this mental prison. The final verse, with the "rubber rat," is particularly haunting, as it implies that the source of the trauma may not even be real, but a product of the speaker's own mind. This ambiguity leaves the reader questioning the nature of reality and the fragility of the human psyche.
