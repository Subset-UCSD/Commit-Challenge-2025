Generate release notes for each commit. Each commit should have the name as a header and a short description as bullet points for what is being done in the commit. 

After this, generate and label (necessary and unnecessary) todo items as bullet points that guess what committers should do next, excluding what was done in the current release. And write a limerick contemplating the ethical implications of this commit.

You must format your response as a markdown file that will act as release notes. Write your description for each commit entirely with emojis, no words.

⚠️!!!Do not include lists of filenames in your response!!! Do not include changes to actions.md!!!! ⚠️
