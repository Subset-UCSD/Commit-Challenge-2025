                <h3>IEEE Website Redesign</h3>
                <p>Led the redesign and development of a new, responsive website for the IEEE student branch at UCSD. The goal was to create a modern, mobile-first platform to better engage with members and promote events. The new site features a clean aesthetic and improved navigation, built from the ground up using React and TypeScript to ensure a maintainable and scalable codebase.</p>

                <h3>Mandelbrot Fractal Explorer</h3>
                <p>A web-based application that allows users to explore the Mandelbrot set in real-time. This project was an exercise in graphics programming and performance optimization, using the HTML5 Canvas to render the fractal. The application features smooth panning and zooming capabilities, calculated client-side with JavaScript, demonstrating an understanding of computational efficiency and browser rendering.</p>

                <h3>Commit Challenge 2025</h3>
                <p>A community-focused project designed to encourage consistent software development habits. The platform challenges users to make a meaningful commit every day for a year. I contributed to the front-end and overall application logic, helping build a tool that fosters growth and collaboration among student developers at UCSD.</p>

                <h3>San Diego CTF Landing Page</h3>
                <p>Developed the public-facing landing page for the San Diego Capture The Flag competition. This project involved creating a visually engaging and informative site to attract participants and provide event details. The focus was on pure, semantic HTML and CSS to create a fast, accessible, and lightweight website that effectively communicates the spirit of the event.</p>

                <h3>CSE 125: Software System Design (Game Dev)</h3>
                <p>As part of UCSD's flagship software engineering course, I collaborated in a small group to design, build, and deploy a real-time multiplayer online game from scratch. This intensive project involved architecting both the client and server, managing network protocols, and implementing game logic under a tight deadline. This project was a deep-dive into C++ development, network programming, and collaborative software engineering.</p>
