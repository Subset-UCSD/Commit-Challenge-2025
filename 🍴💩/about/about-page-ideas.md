# Retrospective

## Team Member Content

- **Overall:** I was unable to find any specific information about Nolan Chai, so I had to use placeholder text for most of the content. If this were a real project, I would have reached out to the stakeholder for this information.
- **Implementation:** I created sections for all 10 points, but they are filled with generic information. The social media and project links are placeholders.

## Design Features

- **Overall:** I was able to implement most of the design features. The page has a dark, glassmorphic aesthetic with glowy text and animated gradients.
- **What was implemented:**
    - Dark Theme: The page uses a dark color palette.
    - Glassmorphism: The main card has a blurred, semi-transparent background.
    - Glowy Text: The main headings have a text-shadow effect that makes them glow.
    - Animated Gradients: The background has a subtle animated gradient.
    - Interactive Elements: Links and skills have hover effects.
    - Minimalist Layout: The layout is clean and focused on the content.
    - Responsive Design: The page is responsive and should look good on most devices.
- **What was not implemented:**
    - Custom Cursor: I decided against a custom cursor as it can sometimes be a usability issue.
    - Parallax Scrolling: This would have required more complex CSS or JavaScript, and I felt it was not essential for this page.
    - Subtle Animations: While there are some hover animations, I did not add any complex on-scroll or on-load animations.
