                    A passionate and driven computer scientist with a keen interest in the security challenges of modern computing and the creative possibilities of game development. I thrive on solving complex problems, whether it's uncovering vulnerabilities in a CTF challenge or architecting a new piece of software. I am dedicated to building robust, efficient, and secure applications.

                        <h3>Cybersecurity &amp; CTFs</h3>
                        <p>I am an avid participant and creator in the Capture The Flag (CTF) community. This has provided me with hands-on experience in vulnerability assessment, reverse engineering, and network security. I enjoy the challenge of both defending systems and understanding offensive tactics to build more secure software. My work on the San Diego CTF landing page reflects my commitment to this community.</p>

                        <h3>Operating Systems</h3>
                        <p>As a Teaching Assistant for the Operating Systems course at UCSD, I have developed a deep, fundamental understanding of core OS principles. I enjoy guiding students through complex topics like process management, memory allocation, and concurrency. This experience has not only solidified my own knowledge but also honed my ability to communicate technical concepts clearly and effectively.</p>

                        <p>I have practical experience designing and building responsive, user-friendly web applications. From redesigning the IEEE at UCSD website with React and TypeScript to creating a fractal explorer with JavaScript, I am proficient in modern web technologies. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code to create performant and visually appealing digital experiences.</p>
